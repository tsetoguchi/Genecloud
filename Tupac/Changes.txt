   Talent Ooh  yeah (Ooh)(Come on  come on)      Pac I see no changes  wake up in the morning and I ask myselfIs life worth livin'  Should I blast myself I'm tired of bein' poor and  even worse  I'm blackMy stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatchCops give a damn about a negroPull the trigger  kill a nigga  he's a hero Give the crack to the kids  who the hell cares One less hungry mouth on the welfare First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothersGive 'em guns  step back  watch 'em kill each other It's time to fight back   that's what Huey saidTwo shots in the dark  now Huey's deadI got love for my brotherBut we can never go nowhere unless we share with each otherWe gotta start makin' changesLearn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangersAnd that's how it's supposed to beHow can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me  UhI'd love to go back to when we played as kidsBut things change  and that's the way it is

--- Dear Mama.txt ---

  You are appreciated    When I was young  me and my mama had beefSeventeen years old  kicked out on the streetsThough back at the time I never thought I'd see her faceAin't a woman alive that could take my mama's placeSuspended from school  and scared to go homeI was a fool  with the big boys breakin' all the rulesI shed tears with my baby sister  over the yearsWe was poorer than the other little kidsAnd even though we had different daddies  the same dramaWhen things went wrong we'd blame MamaI reminisce on the stress I caused  it was hellHuggin' on my mama from a jail cellAnd who'd think in elementary  heyI'd see the penitentiary one day And runnin' from the police  that's rightMama catch me  put a whoopin' to my backsideAnd even as a crack fiend  MamaYou always was a black queen  MamaI finally understandFor a woman  it ain't easy tryin' to raise a manYou always was committedA poor single mother on welfare  tell me how you did itThere's no way I can pay you backBut the plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciated

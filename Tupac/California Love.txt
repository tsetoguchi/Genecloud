[Intro: Roger Troutman]California love[Chorus: Roger Troutman]California knows how to partyCalifornia knows how to partyIn the city of L.AIn the city of good ol' WattsIn the city, the city of ComptonWe keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild WestA state that's untouchable like Eliot NessThe track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chestPack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sexWe in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp beThe state where you never find a dance floor emptyAnd pimps be on a mission for them greensLean mean money-making-machines servin' fiendsI been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunesEver since honeys was wearin' SassoonNow it's '95 and they clock me and watch meDiamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed LiberaceIt's all good, from Diego to the BayYour city is the bomb if your city makin' payThrow up a finger if you feel the same wayDre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

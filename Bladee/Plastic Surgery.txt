 Refrain  Bladee Six in the morning and I'm thinkin' I should end myselfThree P.M. and I'm thinking I should get some helpWoke up feeling like  feeling like I'm not myselfI hear voices  I hear voices when I'm by myself     Bladee No sex with you but I think that you should fuck yourselfIce cream  baby  leave you in the sun and let you meltLife or death  what is the difference  I guess I can't tellGo through hell  I'll make a situation for myselfGo to hell  I'll make a situation for myselfThree vacs on the pack  but you still feel the smellWatch me baby  I come for you  climbing out the wellI was almost at the top but I looked down and fell   Bladee Come and shop with me  mom and dad's moneyPlease stop tagging me  it looks bad on meGot a band with me  we can have a partyMe and bro look clean  plastic surgeryThey wanna be like me  it's emergencyShe say I'm crazy and you worry mePlease stop hurting me  I need surgeryNeed a Burberry for my lil' fairy

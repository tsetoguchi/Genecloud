  I will tell you the truthI wanna take your youthI wanna drink from you  Your blood tastes so sweetLike sugar  babyLike sugar  baby  Demons say  I deserve your DNA Be awake  forever for you  I waitIt's okay  it's okay to go awayIt might take a life to pay  pay it with the razor bladeTell me what you want to sayI can't take the truth today  so tell me a fairy taleHeaven say   I'm on my way I don't care what Heaven say  I'm waiting for your embrace Bridge You don't want me  do you You don't want me  do you Know what I'll do to youWish I never knew youI wonder what you'll doWhen I'm gone

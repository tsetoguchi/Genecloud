[Chorus]Who goes there? It's the ghost of OctoberSummer's over, now I'm goin' nowhereWho holds her? It's not me, I'm a lonerBut I don't wanna go-go-go thereYou're sober, that's not me, I'm a stonerI prefer it when the world moves slowerWho goes there? It's just me and my soldiersI come from the snow, it's cold-cold-colder[Verse]It's bad, it's badYou don't know what I am, I'm a sick manAnd this world feels so distantBut today I'm feelin' so indifferentEvery Friday's HalloweenMy week is a dream, I'm just walkin' in my sleepBy any means, I'll be lowkeyI'm gonna need a reason to be seenAll the prayer is for nothingNo touching, I find it disgustingFlyin' in my lane with my cousinWhy they bugging? I don't do discussionI'm on an airplane to LondonThey want something from me all of a suddenI'll come up when I'm summonedI heard everything was gonna change but it worsened

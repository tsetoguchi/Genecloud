ChorusIn the sewer all alone touch my holeCan't pay you anything right now give you a loanDon't know you you're not my bro where you fromChange my faceI grow my hair need a combSlowly lost to decay lost my hopeDrain Gang and you can't hang with us need a ropeThey're still talking about my name they're on cokeTrashman I waste my days in the smokeVerseI fell off in the nightBring back Thaiboy I say it twice (Thaiboy)Bring myself up to the lightYeah bitch you know I'm highBlood moon forge a contract when it's signedBlood pact I wrote you baby with a knifeTrash Star I eat the night I do it twiceBackstab you out of nowhere you're surprisedBackstab you out of nowhere you're surprisedGoddamn you ain't on shit why you so hypedGoddamn I wonder why am I aliveI give myself up to the red lightI give myself up to the red lightI give myself up to the red light

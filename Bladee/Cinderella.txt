[Verse 1: Bladee]She like me but she think that I'm a weirdoMe and Nino smokin' out the kiloI'm a fiend, bro, I'm calling for a black crowI lost my backbone, don't wanna get it back thoughA lot of black smoke falling from the LamboOn the West Coast, it's just me and EccoYou're holding on to a shadow, gotta let goHeadshot me, I'm swallowed by a black holeTrash Star king, smoke and dirty mirrorsStorm's comin', I feel it in my fingersPuppet king, they dance, CinderellaYour glass shoe don't fit, we gon' steal 'emWho comes out at night? It's a riddleThis not a Oxy', it's a SkittleDrain Gang boys creepin' in the gutterThis not LSD, it's a puzzleThese are not diamonds, frozen waterHope you hate my shit 'cause you're garbageI am home alone in my castleLife was aight, I wanna know what's after[Bridge: Bladee]Blood on bloodI'll bring your end(Love your love)(I'll bring your end)Love your loveBlood on blood (Blood on blood)I'll bring your end

 Chorus  Nicole Miglis Don't let me show crueltyThough I may make mistakesDon't let me show uglinessThough I know I can hateAnd don't let me show evilThough it might be all I takeShow me love  show me loveShow me love Verse 1  Moses Sumney I got a crick in my neck  limp in my stepCrampin' in my muscles every time I try to flexWe're brokenNot really in the right mindset to seem open  openNever really been fought out  like a politician martyrBut you made me listen to your petition riseLove  let's get overIt's very sad  no more loveAll that I could do was remember youOoh-ooh  ooh-ooh  oohYou know I usually say noBut if you throw me love  I'll throw you some more Chorus  Nicole Miglis Don't let me show crueltyThough I may make mistakesDon't let me show uglinessThough I know I can hateAnd don't let me show evilThough it might be all I takeShow me love  show me loveShow me love

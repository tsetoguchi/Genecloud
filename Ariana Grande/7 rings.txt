[Verse 1]Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubblesGirls with tattoos who like getting in troubleLashes and diamonds, ATM machinesBuy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitchWho woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?Rather be tied up with calls and not stringsWrite my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)[Pre-Chorus]My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossyMake big deposits, my gloss is poppin'You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought itI see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)[Chorus]I want it, I got it, I want it, I got itI want it, I got it, I want it, I got itYou like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought itI see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)[Verse 2]Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitchesI'd rather spoil all my friends with my richesThink retail therapy my new addictionWhoever said money can't solve your problemsMust not have had enough money to solve 'emThey say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

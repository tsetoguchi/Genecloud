Verse 1Maybe we could've been friendsIf I met you in another lifeMaybe then we could pretendThere's no gravity in the words we writeMaybe you didn't mean itMaybe blonde was the only rhymeThe only rhymePre-ChorusWant my heart to be breakin' breakin' noI'm happy and you hate it hate it ohAnd I'm not asking you to let it goBut you been tellin' your sideSo I'll be tellin' mine ohChorusYou can tryTo get under my under my under my skinWhile hе's on mineYeah all on my all on my all on my skinI wish you knew that еven youCan't get under my skin if I don't let you inVerse 2You're tellin' it how you see itLike truth is whatever you decideSome people will believe itAnd some will read in between the linesYou're putting me in the spotlightBut I've been under it all my lifeSaid all my life

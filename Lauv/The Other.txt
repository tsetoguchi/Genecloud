[Verse 1]Like a spotlight the water hits meRan it extra cold to shake the words from my mouthThough I know that no oneâ€™s listeningI nervously rehearse for when you're aroundAnd I keep waiting like you might change my mind[Chorus]Who wrote the book on goodbye?There's never been a way to make this easyWhen there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel rightEither your head or your heart, you set the other on fire[Verse 2]Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my headThough I know that our time is endingOh, I'd rather lay forever right in this bedAnd I keep waiting like, you might change my mindGive me one more night[Chorus]Who wrote the book on goodbye?There's never been a way to make this easyWhen there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel rightEither your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

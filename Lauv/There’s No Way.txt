[Verse : Lauv]You touch me and it’s almost like we knewThat there will be history between us twoWe knew someday that we would have regretsBut we just ignored them the night we metWe just dance backwards into each otherTrying to keep our feelings secretly coveredYou touch me and it’s almost like we knewThat there will be history[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]But there’s no way that it’s not going thereWith the way that we’re looking at each otherThere’s no way that it’s not going thereEvery second with you, I want anotherBut maybe we could hold off for one secSo we could keep this tension in checkBut there’s no way that it’s not going thereWith the way that we’re looking at each other[Verse : Julia Michaels,Lauv&Both]I wish I could make the time stopSo we could forget everything and everyoneI wish that the time would line upSo we could just give in to what we want'Cause when I got somebody, you don'tAnd when you got somebody, I don'tI wish that the time would line upSo we could just give in

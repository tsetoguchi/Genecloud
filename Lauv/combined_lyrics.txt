    I've watched those eyes light up with a smileRiver in the not good timesOh  you taught me all that I know (I know)I've seen your soul grow just like a roseMade it through all of those thornsGirl into the woman I know Pre- And it's killing me  me to say  I'm fine    I'm fine When I really mean  mean to say...  You're my all and moreAll I know you taught me  yeahYou're my all and moreBut I need room to breathe  yeah    I found New York laying in your armsWe'll melt into the bedroom floorNever knew I'd stay for so longAnd this truth cuts not through one  but bothNot through one  but both of usBut it's deeper if I hold on

     Lauv Small talk  no conversationThat look makes me impatientI can't tell what you're thinkingPlease  tell me what you're thinkingLast night  we were more than fineJust tell me if you changed your mindIf you changed your mind (Mind) Pre-  Lauv 'Cause I'm all  I'm all inI'm calling  no answerWould you text me when you feel like When it feels right to youBut I'm all  I'm all inI'm falling fasterBut if you're looking at me with a heart of doubt   Lauv Don't kiss me right nowDon't tell me that you need meDon't show up at my houseAll caught up in your feelingsDon't run me 'round and 'roundDon't build me up just to let me downJust to let me down  down  down (Hey)Don't mess with my headDon't tell me you're fallingWith your feet still on the ledgeI'm all out of breathBaby  don't run me 'round and 'roundDon't kiss me  no  don't kiss me right nowOn your lips  just leave itIf you don't mean it

    All I know is (Ooh-ooh-ooh)We could go anywhere  we could doAnything  girl  whatever the mood we're inAll I know is (Ooh-ooh-ooh)Getting lost late at night  under starsFinding love standing right where we are  your lipsThey pull me in the moment  you and I alone andPeople may be watching  I don't mind'Cause  Anywhere with you feels rightAnywhere with you feelslikeParis in the rainParis in the rainWe don't need a fancy townOr bottles that we can't pronounce'Cause anywhere  babeIs like Paris in the rainWhen I'm with youWhen I'm with youParis in the rainParis in the rain    I look at you now and I want this foreverI might not deserve it but there's nothing betterDon't know how I ever did it all without youMy heart is about to  about to jump out of my chestFeelings they come and they go  that they doFeelings they come and they go  not with youThe late nights and the street lights and the peopleLook at me  girl  and the whole world could stop

--- The Other.txt ---

    Like a spotlight the water hits meRan it extra cold to shake the words from my mouthThough I know that no one’s listeningI nervously rehearse for when you're aroundAnd I keep waiting like you might change my mind  Who wrote the book on goodbye There's never been a way to make this easyWhen there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel rightEither your head or your heart  you set the other on fire    Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my headThough I know that our time is endingOh  I'd rather lay forever right in this bedAnd I keep waiting like  you might change my mindGive me one more night  Who wrote the book on goodbye There's never been a way to make this easyWhen there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel rightEither your head or your heart  you set the other on fire

     Lauv You touch me and it’s almost like we knewThat there will be history between us twoWe knew someday that we would have regretsBut we just ignored them the night we metWe just dance backwards into each otherTrying to keep our feelings secretly coveredYou touch me and it’s almost like we knewThat there will be history   Lauv & Julia Michaels But there’s no way that it’s not going thereWith the way that we’re looking at each otherThere’s no way that it’s not going thereEvery second with you  I want anotherBut maybe we could hold off for one secSo we could keep this tension in checkBut there’s no way that it’s not going thereWith the way that we’re looking at each other     Julia Michaels Lauv&Both I wish I could make the time stopSo we could forget everything and everyoneI wish that the time would line upSo we could just give in to what we want'Cause when I got somebody  you don'tAnd when you got somebody  I don'tI wish that the time would line upSo we could just give in

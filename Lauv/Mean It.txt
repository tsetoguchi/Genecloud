[Verse 1: Lauv]Small talk, no conversationThat look makes me impatientI can't tell what you're thinkingPlease, tell me what you're thinkingLast night, we were more than fineJust tell me if you changed your mindIf you changed your mind (Mind)[Pre-Chorus: Lauv]'Cause I'm all, I'm all inI'm calling, no answerWould you text me when you feel like?When it feels right to youBut I'm all, I'm all inI'm falling fasterBut if you're looking at me with a heart of doubt[Chorus: Lauv]Don't kiss me right nowDon't tell me that you need meDon't show up at my houseAll caught up in your feelingsDon't run me 'round and 'roundDon't build me up just to let me downJust to let me down, down, down (Hey)Don't mess with my headDon't tell me you're fallingWith your feet still on the ledgeI'm all out of breathBaby, don't run me 'round and 'roundDon't kiss me, no, don't kiss me right nowOn your lips, just leave itIf you don't mean it

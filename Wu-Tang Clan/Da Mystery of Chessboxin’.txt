[Intro]A game of chess is like a swordfightYou must think first before you moveToad style is immensely strongAnd immune to nearly any weaponWhen it's properly used, it's almost invincible[Verse 1: U-God]Raw, I'ma give it to ya with no triviaRaw like cocaine straight from BoliviaMy hip-hop will rock and shock the nationLike the Emancipation ProclamationWeak MCs approach with slang that's deadYou might as well run into the wall and bang your headI'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fireRap styles vary and carry like MariahI come from the Shaolin slum and the isle I'm fromIs comin' through with 'nough niggas and 'nough gunsSo if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsectionDon't talk the talk if you can't walk the walkPhony niggas are outlined in chalkI'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made meRebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade meSteamrollin' niggas like an eighteen-wheelerWith a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'

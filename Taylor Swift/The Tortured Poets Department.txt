[Verse 1]You left your typewriter at my apartmentStraight from the tortured poets departmentI think some things I never sayLike, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"But you're in self-sabotage modeThrowing spikes down on the roadBut I've seen this episodeand still loved the showWho else decodes you?[Chorus]And who's gonna hold you like me?And who's gonna know you, if not me?I laughed in your face and said"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti SmithThis ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"And who's gonna hold you like me?[Post-Chorus]NobodyNo-fucking-bodyNobody[Verse 2]You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolateWe declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artistI scratch your head, you fall asleepLike a tattooed golden retrieverBut you awaken with dreadPounding nails in your headBut I've read this one where you come undoneI chose this cyclone with you

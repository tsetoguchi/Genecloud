[Verse 1]I walked through the door with you, the air was coldBut somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehowAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's houseAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now[Verse 2]Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gazeWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstateAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into placeAnd I can picture it after all these days[Pre-Chorus]And I know it's long gone andThat magic's not here no moreAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at allOh, oh, oh[Chorus]'Causе there we arе again on that little town streetYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at meWind in my hair, I was thereI remember it all too well[Verse 3]Photo album on the counter,your cheeks were turnin' redYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bedAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on thetee-ball teamYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was meAnd you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' townAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time nowHe's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was'Til we were dead and gone and buriedCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the sameAfter three months in the graveAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for youBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

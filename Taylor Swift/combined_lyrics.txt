    I walked through the door with you  the air was coldBut somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehowAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's houseAnd you've still got it in your drawer  even now    Oh  your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gazeWe're singin' in the car  getting lost upstateAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into placeAnd I can picture it after all these days Pre- And I know it's long gone andThat magic's not here no moreAnd I might be okay  but I'm not fine at allOh  oh  oh  'Causе there we arе again on that little town streetYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at meWind in my hair  I was thereI remember it all too well    Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turnin' redYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bedAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on thetee-ball teamYou taught me 'bout your past  thinkin' your future was meAnd you were tossing me the car keys   Fuck the patriarchy Keychain on the ground  we were always skippin' townAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down   Any time nowHe's gonna say it's love   you never called it what it was'Til we were dead and gone and buriedCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the sameAfter three months in the graveAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for youBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

    Vintage tee  brand new phoneHigh heels on cobblestonesWhen you are young  they assume you know nothingSequin smile  black lipstickSensual politicsWhen you are young  they assume you know nothing  But I knew youDancin' in your Levi'sDrunk under a streetlight  II knew youHand under my sweatshirtBaby  kiss it better  I Refrain And when I felt like I was an old cardiganUnder someone's bedYou put me on and said I was your favorite    A friend to all is a friend to noneChase two girls  lose the oneWhen you are young  they assume you know nothing

     Taylor Swift I was supposed to be sent awayBut they forgot to come and get meI was a functioning alcoholic'Til nobody noticed my new aestheticAll of this to say I hope you're okayBut you're the reasonAnd no one here's to blameBut what about your quiet treason    Taylor Swift And for a fortnight there  we were foreverRun into you sometimes  ask about the weatherNow you're in my backyard  turned into good neighborsYour wife waters flowers  I wanna kill her     Taylor Swift Taylor Swift & Post Malone Post Malone All my mornings are Mondays stuck in anendless FebruaryI took the miracle move-on drug  theeffects were temporaryAnd I love you  it's ruining my lifeI love you  it's ruining my lifeI touched you for only a fortnightI touched you  but I touched you   Taylor Swift Taylor Swift & Post Malone And for a fortnight there we were foreverRun into you sometimes  askabout the weatherNow you're in my backyard  turnedinto good neighborsYour wife waters flowers  I wanna kill herAnd for a fortnight there we were togetherRun into you sometimes  comment on my sweaterNow you're at the mailbox  turned into good neighborsMy husband is cheating  I wanna kill him

    Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flamesIf we know the steps anyway We embroidered the memories of the time I was awayStitching   We were just kids  babe I said   I don't mind  it takes time I thought I was better safe than starry-eyedI felt aglow like thisNever before and never since  If you know it in one glimpse  it's legendaryYou and I go from one kiss to getting marriedStill alivе  killing time at the cemеteryNever quite buriedIn your suit and tie in the nick of timeYou low-down boy  you stand-up guyYou Holy Ghost  you told me I'm the love of your lifeYou said I'm the love of your lifeAbout a million times    Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fateAnd told me I reformed you When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakesWell  you took me to hell tooAnd all at once  the ink bleedsA con man sells a fool a get-love-quick schemeBut I've felt a hole like thisNever before and ever since

    We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til JanuaryAnd this is our place  we make the rulesAnd there's a dazzling haze  a mysterious way about you  dearHave I known you twenty seconds or twenty years   Can I go where you go Can we always be this close Forever and ever  ahTake me out and take me homeYou're my  my  my  my lover    We could let our friends crash in the living roomThis is our place  we make the callAnd I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants youI've loved you three summers now  honey  but I want 'em all  Can I go where you go Can we always be this close Forever and ever  ahTake me out and take me home (Forever and ever)You're my  my  my  my lover

    I'm doing good  I'm on some new shitBeen saying  yes  instead of  no I thought I saw you at the bus stop  I didn't thoughI hit the ground running each nightI hit the Sunday matinéeYou know the greatest films of all time were never made Pre- I guess you never know  never knowAnd if you wanted me  you really should've showedAnd if you never bleed  you're never gonna growAnd it's alright now  But we were something  don't you think so Roaring twenties  tossing pennies in the poolAnd if my wishes came trueIt would've been youIn my defense  I have noneFor never leaving well enough aloneBut it would've been funIf you would've been the one(Ooh)    I have this dream you're doing cool shitHaving adventures on your ownYou meet some woman on the internet and take her homeWe never painted by the numbers  babyBut we were making it countYou know the greatest loves of all time are over now

    You left your typewriter at my apartmentStraight from the tortured poets departmentI think some things I never sayLike   Who uses typewriters anyway  But you're in self-sabotage modeThrowing spikes down on the roadBut I've seen this episodeand still loved the showWho else decodes you   And who's gonna hold you like me And who's gonna know you  if not me I laughed in your face and said You're not Dylan Thomas  I'm not Patti SmithThis ain't the Chelsea Hotel  we'rе modern idiots And who's gonna hold you like me  Post- NobodyNo-fucking-bodyNobody    You smokеd  then ate seven bars of chocolateWe declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artistI scratch your head  you fall asleepLike a tattooed golden retrieverBut you awaken with dreadPounding nails in your headBut I've read this one where you come undoneI chose this cyclone with you

    When I picture my hometownThere's a bronze  spray-tanned statue of youAnd a plaque underneath itThat threatens to push me down the stairs at our school Pre- And it was always the same searing painBut I dreamed that one day I could say  All that time you were throwin' punches  I was buildin' somethin'And I can't forgive the way you made me feelScreamed   Fuck you  Aimee  to the night sky as the blood was gushin'But I can't forget the way you made me heal    And it wasn't a fair fightOr a clean killeach time that Aimee stompеd across my graveAnd then she wrotе headlinesIn the local paper  laughing at each baby step I'd take Pre- And it was always the same searing painBut I prayed that one day I could say

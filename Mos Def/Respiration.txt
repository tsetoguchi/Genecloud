[Intro]"What'd you do last night?""We did, umm, two whole carsIt was me, Dez, and Mean Three, right?And on the first car, in small letters, it said 'All you see is'And then, you know, big, big, you know, some block silver lettersThat said 'crime in the city', right?""It just took up the whole car?""Yeah, yeah, it was a whole car and shit..."Escúchela, la ciudad respirandoEscúchela, la ciudad respirandoEscúchela, la ciudad respirandoEscúchela...[Verse 1: Mos Def]The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolisShinin', like "Who on top of this?"People was tusslin', arguin' and bustlin'Gangstas ofGothamhardcore hustlin'I'm wrestlin' with words and ideasMy ears is pricked, seekin' what will transmitThe scribes can apply the transcriptYo! This ain't no time where the usual is suitableTonight alive, let's describe the inscrutableThe indisputable (What!)We New York, the narcotics, draped in metal and fiber opticsWhere mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips for profitsThirsty criminals sic pocketsHard knuckles on the second hands of working-class watchesSkyscrapers is colossus, the cost of livin' is preposterousStay alive? You pay or die, no optionsNo Batman and RobinCan't tell between the cops and the robbersThey both partners, they all heartless, with no conscienceBack streets stay darkenedWhile unbeliever hearts stay hardenedMy eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin'You either make your way or stay sobbin'The shiny Apple is bruised but sweet,and if you choose to eatYou could lose your teeth, many crews retreatNightly news repeat who got shot down and locked downSpotlight the savages, NASDAQ averagesMy narrative rose to explain this existenceAmidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

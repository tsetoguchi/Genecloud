Yasiin Bey The way I feel — sometimes  it's too hard to sit stillThings are so passionate  times are so realSometimes I try and chill  mellow down  blowin' smokeSmile on my face  but it's really no jokeYou feel it in the street  the people breathe without hopeThey goin' through the motion  they dimmin' down the focusThe focus get cleared  then the light turn sharpAnd the eyes go teary  the mind grow wearyI speak it so clearly  sometimes  y'all don't hear meI push it past the bass  know nations gotta feel meI feel it in my bones  blackI'm so wide awake that I'm hardly ever 'sleepMy flow forever deepAnd it's volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beatMy presence speak volumes before I say a wordI'm everywhere — penthouse  pavement and curbCradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cellUniversal ghetto life — holla  black  you know it wellQuiet storm  vital form  pen pushed it right acrossMind is a vital force; high  low or right acrossSoul is the lion's roar  voice is the sirenI swing 'round  ring out  and bring down the tyrantShocked a small action knock a giant lopsidedThe world is so dangerous  there's no need for frightenin'Suckers tryin' to hide like the struggle won't find 'emThen  the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind 'emIt's everywhere! — Penthouse  pavement and curbCradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cellUniversal ghetto life — holla  black  you know it well

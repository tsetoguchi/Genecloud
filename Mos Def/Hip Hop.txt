[Intro]You say, "one for the treble, two for the time"Come on, y'all, let's rock this!You say, "one for the treble, two for the time"Come on!Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shapeNow let it fall, huh![Verse 1]My restlessness is my nemesisIt's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to pageI write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for daysScrutinize my literature from the large to the miniatureI mathematically add-minister, subtract the wackSelector, wheel it back, I'm feeling thatAhaha, from the core to the perimeter blackYou know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)Full-blooded, full throttleBreathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the humYoung man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!Native son, speaking in the native tongueI got my eyes on tomorrow (There it is)While you still tryna find where it isI'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silentlyShine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpseEmbrace the bass with my dark ink fingertipsUsed to speak the King's EnglishBut caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like disLong range from thebase-line(swish)Move like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunition(Chi-chi-pow)Move from the gate, voice cuedOn your tape, putting food on your plateMany crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)We went from picking cottonTo chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-HoppingBlues people got the blue chip stock optionInvisible man, got the whole world watching(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your mapI'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hopWhere you can either get paid or get shotWhen your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flockWhen your chart position drop, then the phone calls....Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spotDon't gas yourself,akh'The industry just a better built cell blockA long way from the shell topsAnd the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)

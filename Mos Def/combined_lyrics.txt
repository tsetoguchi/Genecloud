   Yasiin Bey PeaceDa-da-da-da-daPeace  peace  peace  peace  peace  peacePowerUghMad LiberatorDef operatorRock the dataAmazin' flavorYo!     Yasiin Bey The way I feel — sometimes  it's too hard to sit stillThings are so passionate  times are so realSometimes I try and chill  mellow down  blowin' smokeSmile on my face  but it's really no jokeYou feel it in the street  the people breathe without hopeThey goin' through the motion  they dimmin' down the focusThe focus get cleared  then the light turn sharpAnd the eyes go teary  the mind grow wearyI speak it so clearly  sometimes  y'all don't hear meI push it past the bass  know nations gotta feel meI feel it in my bones  blackI'm so wide awake that I'm hardly ever 'sleepMy flow forever deepAnd it's volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beatMy presence speak volumes before I say a wordI'm everywhere — penthouse  pavement and curbCradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cellUniversal ghetto life — holla  black  you know it wellQuiet storm  vital form  pen pushed it right acrossMind is a vital force; high  low or right acrossSoul is the lion's roar  voice is the sirenI swing 'round  ring out  and bring down the tyrantShocked a small action knock a giant lopsidedThe world is so dangerous  there's no need for frightenin'Suckers tryin' to hide like the struggle won't find 'emThen  the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind 'emIt's everywhere! — Penthouse  pavement and curbCradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cellUniversal ghetto life — holla  black  you know it well

  You say   one for the treble  two for the time Come on  y'all  let's rock this!You say   one for the treble  two for the time Come on!Speech is my hammer  bang the world into shapeNow let it fall  huh!    My restlessness is my nemesisIt's hard to really chill and sit still  committed to pageI write a rhyme  sometimes won't finish for daysScrutinize my literature from the large to the miniatureI mathematically add-minister  subtract the wackSelector  wheel it back  I'm feeling thatAhaha  from the core to the perimeter blackYou know the motto  stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)Full-blooded  full throttleBreathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the humYoung man  where you from  Brooklyn number one!Native son  speaking in the native tongueI got my eyes on tomorrow (There it is)While you still tryna find where it isI'm on the Ave where it lives and dies  violently but silentlyShine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpseEmbrace the bass with my dark ink fingertipsUsed to speak the King's EnglishBut caught a rash on my lips  so now my chat just like disLong range from thebase-line(swish)Move like an apparition  low to the ground with ammunition(Chi-chi-pow)Move from the gate  voice cuedOn your tape  putting food on your plateMany crews can relate  who choosing your fate (yo)We went from picking cottonTo chain gang line chopping  to Be-Bopping  to Hip-HoppingBlues people got the blue chip stock optionInvisible man  got the whole world watching(Where ya at ) I'm high  low  east  west  all over your mapI'm getting big props  with this thing called hip hopWhere you can either get paid or get shotWhen your product in stock  the fair-weather friends flockWhen your chart position drop  then the phone calls....Chill for a minute  let's see who else hot  snatch your shelf spotDon't gas yourself akh'The industry just a better built cell blockA long way from the shell topsAnd the bells that L rocked (rock  rock  rock  rock...)

   What'd you do last night   We did  umm  two whole carsIt was me  Dez  and Mean Three  right And on the first car  in small letters  it said 'All you see is'And then  you know  big  big  you know  some block silver lettersThat said 'crime in the city'  right   It just took up the whole car   Yeah  yeah  it was a whole car and shit...

  Look  if you had one shot or one opportunityTo seize everything you ever wanted in one momentWould you capture it or just let it slip Yo    His palms are sweaty  knees weak  arms are heavyThere's vomit on his sweater already  mom's spaghettiHe's nervous  but on the surface  he looks calm and readyTo drop bombs  but he keeps on forgettingWhat he wrote down  the whole crowd goes so loudHe opens his mouth  but the words won't come outHe's chokin'  how  Everybody's jokin' nowThe clock's run out  time's up  over  blaowSnap back to reality  ope  there goes gravityOpe  there goes Rabbit  he choked  he's so madBut he won't give up that easy  no  he won't have itHe knows his whole back's to these ropes  it don't matterHe's dope  he knows that  but he's broke  he's so stagnantHe knows when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it'sBack to the lab again  yo  this old rhapsodyBetter go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  You better lose yourself in the musicThe moment  you own it  you better never let it go (Go)You only get one shot  do not miss your chance to blowThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime  yoYou better lose yourself in the musicThe moment  you own it  you better never let it go (Go)You only get one shot  do not miss your chance to blowThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime  yoYou better

  YeahI know sometimesThings may not always make sense to you right nowBut heyWhat Daddy always tell you Straighten up  little soldierStiffen up that upper lipWhat you cryin' about You got me    Hailie  I know you miss your mom  and I know you miss your dadWhen I'm gone  but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never hadI can see you're sad  even when you smile  even when you laughI can see it in your eyes  deep inside you wanna cry'Cause you're scared  I ain't there  Daddy's wit' you in your prayersNo more cryin'  wipe them tears  Daddy's here  no more nightmaresWe gon' pull together through it  we gon' do itLainie  Uncle's crazy  ain't he  Yeah  but he loves you  girl  and you better know itWe're all we got in this world when it spins  when it swirlsWhen it whirls  when it twirls  two little beautiful girlsLookin' puzzled  in a daze  I know it's confusin' youDaddy's always on the move  Mama's always on the newsI try to keep you sheltered from it  but somehow it seemsThe harder that I try to do that  the more it backfires on meAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to seeDaddy don't want you to see  but you see just as much as he didWe did not plan it to be this way  your mother and meBut things have got so bad between us  I don't see us ever bein'Together ever again  like we used to be when we was teenagersBut then  of course  everything always happens for a reasonI guess it was never meant to beBut it's just somethin' we have no control over  and that's what destiny isBut no more worries  rest your head and go to sleepMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

   Look  I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings  But I'm only going to get this one chance (Six minutes—  six minutes—) Something's wrong  I can feel it (Six minutes  Slim Shady  you're on!) Just a feeling I've got  like something's about to happen  but I don't know what.If that means what I think it means  we're in trouble  big trouble;And if he is as bananas as you say  I'm not taking any chances  You are just what the doc ordered   I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God  Rap GodAll my people from the front to the back nod  back nodNow  who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box They said I rap like a robot  so call me Rap-bot    But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genesI got a laptop in my back pocketMy pen'll go off when I half-cock itGot a fat knot from that rap profitMade a livin' and a killin' off itEver since Bill Clinton was still in officeWith Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsackI'm an MC still as honestBut as rude and as indecent as all hellSyllables  skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hopYou don't really wanna get into a pissin' matchWith this rappity brat  packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'Backpack rap crap  yap-yap  yackety-yackAnd at the exact same time  I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' thatI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' tableOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in halfOnly realized it was ironic  I was signed to Aftermath after the factHow could I not blow  All I do is drop F-bombsFeel my wrath of attackRappers are havin' a rough time period  here's a maxi padIt's actually disastrously bad for the wackWhile I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

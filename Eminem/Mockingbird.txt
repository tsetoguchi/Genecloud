[Intro]YeahI know sometimesThings may not always make sense to you right nowBut heyWhat Daddy always tell you?Straighten up, little soldierStiffen up that upper lipWhat you cryin' about?You got me[Verse 1]Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dadWhen I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never hadI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laughI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayersNo more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmaresWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do itLainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know itWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirlsWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girlsLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' youDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the newsI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seemsThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on meAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to seeDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he didWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and meBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagersBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reasonI guess it was never meant to beBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny isBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleepMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

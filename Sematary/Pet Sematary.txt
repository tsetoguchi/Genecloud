    Under the arc of a weather stain boardsAncient goblins and warlordsCome out of the ground  not making a soundThe smell of death is all aroundAnd the night when the cold wind blowsNo one cares  nobody knows  I don't wanna be buried in a pet semataryI don't want to live my life againI don't wanna be buried in a pet semataryI don't want to live my life again    Follow Victor to the sacred placeThis ain't a dream  I can't escapeMolars and fangs  the clicking of bonesSpirits moaning among the tombstonesAnd the night  when the moon is brightSomeone cries  something ain't right  I don't wanna be buried in a pet semataryI don't want to live my life againI don't wanna be buried in a pet semataryI don't want to live my life again

# Genecloud

Make a lyric based word cloud of the top 10 songs for any artist within the Genius database.

## Quickstart

1. Acquire a Genius Access Token from the Genius API and place it in the text file named `api_token.txt` within two quotation marks:

`"(access token here)"`.

2. Edit the `artists` list in `main.py` with the artist(s) you wish to create word clouds for.

  If you don't wanna see me    Did a full one-eighty  crazyThinking 'bout the way I wasDid the heartbreak change me  MaybeBut look at where I ended up Refrain I'm all good alreadySo moved on  it's scaryI'm not where you left me at all  so Pre- If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebodyIf you wanna believe that anything could stop me  Don't show up  don't come outDon't start caring about me nowWalk away  you know howDon't start caring about me now    Aren't you the guy who tried toHurt me with the word  goodbye  Though it took some time to survive youI'm better on the other side

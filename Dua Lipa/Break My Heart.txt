[Verse 1]I've always been the one to say the first goodbyeHad to love and lose a hundred million timesHad to get it wrong to know just what I likeNow I'm fallingYou say my name like I have never heard beforeI'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sureI hope I'm not the only one that feels it allAre you falling?[Pre-Chorus]Centre of attentionYou know you can get whatever you want from meWhenever you want it, babyIt's you in my reflectionI'm afraid of all the things it could do to meIf I would've known it, baby[Chorus]I would've stayed at home'Cause I was doing better aloneBut when you said, "Hello"I knew that was the end of it allI should've stayed at home'Cause now there ain't no letting you goAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?Oh no, I was doing better aloneBut when you said, "Hello"I knew that was the end of it allI should've stayed at home'Cause now there ain't no letting you goAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 1]You call me all friendlyTellin' me how much you miss meThat's funny, I guess you've heard my songsWell, I'm too busy for your businessGo find a girl who wants to listen'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong[Pre-Chorus]So I cut you offI don't need your love'Cause I already cried enoughI've been doneI've been movin' on since we said goodbyeI cut you offI don't need your loveSo you can try all you wantYour time is up, I'll tell you why[Chorus]You say you're sorry, but it's too late nowSo save it, get gone, shut up'Cause if you think I care about you nowWell, boy, I don't give a fuck[Verse 2]I remember that weekendWhen my best friend caught you creepin'You blamed it all on the alcoholSo, I made my decision'Cause you made your bed, sleep in itPlay the victim and switch your positionI'm through, I'm done

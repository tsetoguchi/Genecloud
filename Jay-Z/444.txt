I said   Don't embarrass me  instead of  Be mine That was my proposal for us to go steadyThat was your   st birthdayYou matured faster than me  I wasn't readySo I apologizeI seen the innocence leave your eyesI still mourn its death andI apologize for all the stillborns'Cause I wasn't present  your body wouldn't accept itI apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions'Cause I was emotionlessAnd I apologize 'cause at your best  you are loveAnd because I fall short of what I say I'm all aboutYour eyes leave with the soul that your body once housedAnd you stare blankly into spaceThinkin' of all the time  you wasted it on all this basic shitSo I apologize

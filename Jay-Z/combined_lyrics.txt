   Hannah Williams Do I find it so hardWhen I know in my heartI'm letting you down every dayLetting you down every dayWhy do I keep on running away      JAY-Z Look  I apologize  often womanizeTook for my child to be born  see through a woman's eyesTook for these natural twins to believe in miraclesTook me too long for this song  I don't deserve youI harassed you out in Paris Please come back to Rome  you make it home We talked for hours when you were on tour Please pick up the phone  pick up the phone! I said   Don't embarrass me  instead of  Be mine That was my proposal for us to go steadyThat was your   st birthdayYou matured faster than me  I wasn't readySo I apologizeI seen the innocence leave your eyesI still mourn its death andI apologize for all the stillborns'Cause I wasn't present  your body wouldn't accept itI apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions'Cause I was emotionlessAnd I apologize 'cause at your best  you are loveAnd because I fall short of what I say I'm all aboutYour eyes leave with the soul that your body once housedAnd you stare blankly into spaceThinkin' of all the time  you wasted it on all this basic shitSo I apologize

[Hook]With a little bit of gold and a pagerWith a little bit of gold and a pagerWith a little bit of gold and a pagerWith a little bit of gold and a pagerWith a little bit of gold and a pager[Verse 1:  Chuck Inglish]Pedal down the foothills, wheelies on the front wheel(For real Chuck?) Not for play homebroI made those and those, I skate those in theseI take those and wear them like I made those even if I don't cuzzoI'll take those like thatPut them in my knapsack, snap the top latchFour finger ringon my belt buckle strapGot to hold up my jeans cause they falling off my assThen you got to check these Nikes at the bottom of my pantsThen you got to check my hip cause my beeper's on blastJust got it activated, you ain't even got to askSo if my phone's off you can page my assSo I guess what it is, is I'm who I'm isAnd I'm well aware, a gold rope's what I wearAnd they're big and they hang and they swang here to thereAnd I'm here (With a little bit of gold and a pager)

[Verse 1]I caught it bad yesterdayYou hit me with a call to your placeAin't been out in a while anywayWas hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my faceRomantic talkin'? You don't even have to tryYou're cute enough to fuck with me tonightLookin' at the table, all I see is weed and whiteBaby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right[Pre-Chorus]Cocaine and drinkin' with your friendsYou live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretendI'm not fazed, only here to sinIf Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can[Chorus]Call me when you want, call me when you needCall me in the morning, I'll be on the wayCall me when you want, call me when you needCall me out by your name, I'll be on the way like[Post-Chorus]Mm, mm, mmMm, mm, mm

Written by Julia Michaels Justin Tranter and Justin BieberVerse 1You gotta go and get angry at all of my honestyYou know I try but I don't do too well with apologiesI hope I don't run out of time could someone call a referee'Cause I just need one more shot at forgivenessI know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twiceAnd by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred timesSo let me oh let me redeem oh redeem oh myself tonight'Cause I just need one more shot at second chancesChorusYeah is it too late now to say sorry'Cause I'm missing more than just your bodyOh is it too late now to say sorryYeah I know that I let you downIs it too late to say I'm sorry nowDropI'm sorry yeahSorry yeahSorryYeah I know that I let you downIs it too late to say I'm sorry now

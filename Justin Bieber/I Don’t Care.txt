[Verse : Ed Sheeran]I'm at a party I don't wanna be atAnd I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeahWonderin' if I could sneak out the backNobody's even lookin' me in my eyesThen you take my handFinish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?You make it better like that[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]Don't think I fit in at this partyEveryone's got so much to say (Yeah)I always feel like I'm nobody, mmmWho wants to fit in anyway?[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeahAll the bad things disappearAnd you're making me feel like maybe I am somebodyI can deal with the bad nightsWhen I'm with my baby, yeahOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me nearYou can take me anywhereAnd you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebodyI can deal with the bad nightsWhen I'm with my baby, yeahOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

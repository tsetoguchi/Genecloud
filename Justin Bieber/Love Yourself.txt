Verse 1For all the times that you rained on my paradeAnd all the clubs you get in using my nameYou think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness' sakeYou think I'm cryin' on my own well I ain'tRefrainAnd I didn't wanna write a song'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still careI don't but you still hit my phone upAnd baby I'll be movin' onAnd I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold backMaybe you should know thatPre-ChorusMy mama don't like you and she likes everyoneAnd I never like to admit that I was wrongAnd I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going onBut now I know I'm better sleeping on my ownChorus'Cause if you like the way you look that muchOh baby you should go and love yourselfAnd if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'You should go and love yourself

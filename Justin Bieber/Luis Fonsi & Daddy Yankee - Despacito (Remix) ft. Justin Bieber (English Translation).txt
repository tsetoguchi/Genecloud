[Intro: Justin Bieber]Come and move that in my directionSo thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeahTurn every situation into heaven, yeahOh, you areMy sunrise on the darkest dayGot me feelin' some kind of wayMake me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowlyYou fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it onGot the only key, know how to turn it onThe way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hearBaby, take it slow so we can last long[Verse : Luis Fonsi &Daddy Yankee]Oh, you, you are the magnet and I'm the metalI keep getting closer and building up the planJust thinking about it raises my heartbeatOh, yeahI, I'm already liking you more than usualAll my senses are asking for moreThis needs to be taken with no hurry[Chorus: Luis Fonsi,Daddy Yankee&Justin Bieber]SlowlyI want to smell your neck slowlyLet me whisper things in your earSo that you'll remember if you're not with meSlowlyI want to undress you with my kisses, slowlyI sign the walls of your labyrinthAnd make your whole body a manuscript(Hop on, hop on, hop on!Hop on, hop on!)

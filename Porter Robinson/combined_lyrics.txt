I CLOSE MY EYES FOR ONCE I DON'T HAVE TO TRY I'M WELL-WISHING FOR A LIFE I PICTURE YOU HAPPY OH IN THE WEEDS WE WALKED YOUR HAND RUNNING THROUGH THE MOSS I WAS SO LOST IN THOUGHT BUT YOU WERE THERE LIVING YOU'VE TAKEN ME WITH YOU CAN I SLOW THE DAYS I'LL WISH THAT I'LL FIND THE FAITH I'LL DIE AND I'LL SAVE YOUR PLACE AND YOU'LL NEVER SUFFER WE'LL STAY TOGETHER OH IT'S NOT ALRIGHT THAT ONE DAY WE'RE ALL OUT OF TIME I'LL WRITE YOU ANOTHER LIFE I'M SORRY FOR CRYING IT'S JUST THAT I LOVE YOU ONE DAY CAN'T BE FAR ENOUGH I HAD LOST MY SIGHT SO YOU SANG TO ME THE BEAUTY YOU'D BEEN SEEING IF I CAN'T STOP TIME I'LL BUILD A WORLD WHERE GOD CANNOT TAKE US THERE'S NO NEED TO THINK OF TIME

 Chorus  Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise Kendrick Lamar I am a sinnerWho's probably gonna sin againLord  forgive me  Lord  forgive meThings I don't understandSometimes  I need to be aloneBitch  don't kill my vibe  bitch  don't kill my vibeI can feel your energy from two planets awayI got my drink  I got my music  I would share it  but  today  I'm yellin'Bitch  don't kill my vibe  bitch  don't kill my vibeBitch  don't kill my vibe  bitch  don't kill my vibe Verse 1  Kendrick Lamar Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get richLook inside of your soul and you can find out it never existI can feel the changesI can feel a new life  I always knew life can be dangerousI can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painlessYou don't know what pain isHow can I paint this picture when the colorblind is hangin' witcha Fell on my face and awoke with a scar  another mistake livin' deep in my heartWear it on top of my sleeve in a flick I can admit that it did look like yoursWhy you resent every makin' of his Tell me your purpose is petty againBut even a small lighter can burn a bridge  even a small lighter can burn a bridge Pre-Chorus  Kendrick Lamar I can feel the changesI can feel the new people 'round me just wanna be famousYou can see that my city found me  then put me on stagesTo me  that's amazin'To you  that's a quick check with all disrespect  let me say this

 Verse 1 Dear AdonisI'm sorry that that man is your father  let me be honestIt takes a man to be a man  your dad is not responsiveI look at him and wish your grandpa woulda wore a condomI'm sorry that you gotta grow up and then stand behind himLife is hard  I know  the challenge is always gon' beat us homeSometimes our parents make mistakes that affect us until we grownAnd you're a good kid that need good leadershipLet me be your mentor since your daddy don't teach you shitNever let a man piss on your leg  sonEither you die right there or pop that man in the head  sonNever fall in the escort business  that's bad religionPlease remember  you could be a bitch even if you got bitchesNever code-switch  whether right or wrong  you're a Black manEven if it don't benefit your goals  do some push-ups  get some disciplineDon't cut them corners like your daddy did  fuck what Ozempic didDon't pay to play with them Brazilians  get a gym membershipUnderstand  no throwin' rocks and hidin' hands  that's lawDon't be ashamed 'bout who you wit'  that's how he treat your momsDon't have a kid to hide a kid to hide again  be sureFive percent will comprehend  but ninety-five is lostBe proud of who you are  your strength come from withinLotta superstars that's real  but your daddy ain't one of themAnd you nothing like him  you'll carry yourself as kingCan't understand me right now  Just play this when you eighteen

 Chorus  Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise Kendrick Lamar I am a sinnerWho's probably gonna sin againLord  forgive me  Lord  forgive meThings I don't understandSometimes  I need to be aloneBitch  don't kill my vibe  bitch  don't kill my vibeI can feel your energy from two planets awayI got my drink  I got my music  I would share it  but  today  I'm yellin'Bitch  don't kill my vibe  bitch  don't kill my vibeBitch  don't kill my vibe  bitch  don't kill my vibe Verse 1  Kendrick Lamar Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get richLook inside of your soul and you can find out it never existI can feel the changesI can feel a new life  I always knew life can be dangerousI can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painlessYou don't know what pain isHow can I paint this picture when the colorblind is hangin' witcha Fell on my face and awoke with a scar  another mistake livin' deep in my heartWear it on top of my sleeve in a flick I can admit that it did look like yoursWhy you resent every makin' of his Tell me your purpose is petty againBut even a small lighter can burn a bridge  even a small lighter can burn a bridge Pre-Chorus  Kendrick Lamar I can feel the changesI can feel the new people 'round me just wanna be famousYou can see that my city found me  then put me on stagesTo me  that's amazin'To you  that's a quick check with all disrespect  let me say this

 Part I  Refrain  Kendrick Lamar &ScHoolboy Q If Pirus and Crips all got alongThey'd probably gun me down by the end of this songSeem like the whole city go against meEvery time I'm in the street  I hear—Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!   Kendrick Lamar Man down  where you from  nigga Fuck who you know—where you from  my nigga Where your grandma stay  huh  my nigga This m.A.A.d city I run  my nigga   Kendrick Lamar Brace yourself  I'll take you on a trip down memory laneThis is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaineThis is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major painNot the drill sergeant  but the stress that weighin' on your brainIt was me  L Boog  and Yan Yan  YG Lucky ride down RosecransIt got ugly  wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourselfUh  Warriors and Conans hope euphoria can slow danceWith society the driver seat  the first one to get killedSeen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown outAt the same burger stand where      hang outNow this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did itBut ever since that day  I was lookin' at him differentThat was back when I was nine  Joey packed the ninePakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crimePack a van with four guns at a timeWith the sliding door  fuck is up Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up  you fuckin' punk Pickin' up the fuckin' pump  pickin' off you suckersSuck a dick or die or sucker punchA wall of bullets comin' from AK's  AR's  Ayy  y'all—duck That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunchAw man  goddamn  all hell broke looseYou killed my cousin back in '    fuck yo' truceNow crawl your head in that nooseYou wind up dead on the newsAin't no peace treaty  just piecin' BGs up to pre-approveBodies on top of bodies  IVs on top of IVsObviously the coroner between the sheets like the IsleysWhen you hop on that trolley  make sure your color's correctMake sure you're corporate  or they'll be callin' your mother collectThey say the governor collect all of our taxes  exceptWhen we in traffic and tragic happens  that shit ain't no threatYou movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TECGo buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial  I guess​m.A.A.d. city
